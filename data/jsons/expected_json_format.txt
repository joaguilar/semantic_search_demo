    "content": "Text with the document content that will be split into sentences, each sentence vectorized and indexed.",
    "content_split": [
        "Optional.",
        "If you want a different split of the text, say by paragraph, for vectorization, add the pieces of code here",
        "The content field would then only be stored in the parent document, and the child would be created from the entries in this field"],
